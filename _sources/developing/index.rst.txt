Developing
----------

We'd like this to be a community driven project, so all kinds of input
are welcome!

There are numerous way you could contribute:

-  Report bugs by submitting issues
-  Request features by submitting issues
-  Write examples and improve documentation
-  Contribute code: bug fixes, new features

This document is loosely based on the `Contributing to xarray guide`_.
It's worth reading, it covers many of the subjects below in greater
detail.

Reporting bugs
--------------

You can report bugs on the *Issues* `pages`_. Please include a
self-contained Python snippet that reproduces the problem. In the
majority of cases, a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example (MCVE) or
Minimum Working Example (MWE) is the best way to communicate the problem
and provide insight. Have a look at `this stackoverflow article`_ for an
in-depth description.
