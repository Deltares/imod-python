Building documentation and examples
-----------------------------------

In the ``docs`` directory, run:

.. code-block:: console

   make html
   
On Windows:

.. code-block:: console

   .\make.bat html

Sphinx will build the documentation in a few steps. This is generally useful,
as it means only part of the documentation needs to be rebuilt after some
changes. However, to start afresh, run:

.. code-block:: console

   python clean.py
   
This will get rid of all files generated by Sphinx.

Creating the docs can also be done using pixi. Run the following command to build it:

.. code-block:: console

   pixi run --environment default docs
