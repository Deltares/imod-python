    Parameters
    ----------
    head: array of floats (xr.DataArray)
        is the initial (starting) headâ€”that is, head at the beginning of the GWF
        Model simulation. STRT must be specified for all simulations, including
        steady-state simulations. One value is read for every model cell. For
        simulations in which the first stress period is steady state, the values
        used for STRT generally do not affect the simulation (exceptions may
        occur if cells go dry and (or) rewet). The execution time, however, will
        be less if STRT includes hydraulic heads that are close to the
        steadystate solution. A head value lower than the cell bottom can be
        provided if a cell should start as dry. (strt)
