Raster data and xarray
======================

Geospatial data primarily comes in two forms: raster data and vector data.
This guide focuses on the first.

Raster data consists of rows and columns of rectangular cells. Their location
in space is defined by the number of rows, the number of columns, a cell size
along the rows, a cell size along the columns, the origin (x, y), and
optionally rotation (x, y) -- an `affine`_ matrix.

Typical examples of file formats containing raster data are:

* GeoTIFF
* ESRII ASCII
* netCDF
* IDF

In groundwater modeling, data commonly stored in raster format are:

* Layer topology: the tops and bottoms of geohydrological layers
* Layer properties: conductivity of aquifers and aquitards
* Model output: heads or cell by cell flows

These data consist of values for every single cell. Xarray provides many
conveniences for such data, such as plotting or selecting. To demonstrate,
we'll get some sample data provided with the imod package.
"""

import xarray as xr

# %%
import imod

elevation = imod.data.ahn()["ahn"]
elevation

# %%
# Two dimensions: x, y
# --------------------
#
# This dataset represents some surface elevation in the west of the
# Netherlands, in the form of an xarray DataArray.
#
# Xarray provides a "rich" representation of this data, note the x and y coordinates
# are shown above. We can use these coordinates for plotting, selecting, etc.

elevation.plot()

# %%
# This creates an informative plot.
#
# We can also easily make a selection of a 10 by 10 km square, and plot the
# result:

selection = elevation.sel(x=slice(100_000.0, 110_000.0), y=slice(460_000.0, 450_000.0))
selection.plot()

# %%
# More dimensions
# ---------------
#
# Raster data can also be "stacked" to represent additional dimensions, such as
# height or time. Xarray is fully N-dimensional, and can directly represent
# these data.
#
# Let's start with a three dimensional example: a geohydrological layer model.

layermodel = imod.data.hondsrug_layermodel()
layermodel

# %%
# This dataset contains multiple variables. We can take a closer look at the
# the "top" variable, which represents the top of every layer.

top = layermodel["top"]
top

# %%
# This DataArray has three dimensions: layer, y, x. We can't make a planview
# plot of this entire dataset: every (x, y) locations has as many values as
# layers. A single layer can be selected and shown as follows:

top.sel(layer=1).plot()

# %%
# Xarray doesn't favor specific dimensions. We can select a value along the
# y-axis just as easily, to create a cross-section.

section = top.sel(y=560_000.0, method="nearest")
section.plot.line(x="x")

# %%
# Xarray provides us a lot of convenience compared to working with traditional
# two dimensional rasters: rather than continuously loop over the data of single
# timesteps or layers, we can process them in a single command.
#
# For example, to compute the thickness of every layer:

thickness = layermodel["top"] - layermodel["bottom"]
thickness

# %%
# This is easily multiplied, then summed over the layer dimensions to provide
# us a map of the total transmissivity:

transmissivity = layermodel["k"] * thickness
total = transmissivity.sum("layer")
total.plot()

# %%
# Input and output
# ----------------
#
# The imod package started as a collection of functions to read IDF files
# into xarray DataArrays. By convention, IDF files store the coordinates
# of the extra dimensions (layer, time) in the file name.
# :py:func:`imod.idf.save` will automatically generate these names from
# a DataArray.
#
# Let's demonstrate by writing the transmissivity computed above to IDF.
# (We'll do this in a temporary directory to keep things tidy.)

tempdir = imod.util.temporary_directory()
imod.idf.save(tempdir / "transmissivity", transmissivity)

# %%
# .. note::
#
#   ``tempdir`` is a Python ``pathlib.Path`` object. These objects
#   are very convenient for working with paths; we can easily check
#   if paths exists, join paths with ``/``, etc.
#
# Let's check which files have been written in the temporary directory:

filenames = [path.name for path in tempdir.iterdir()]
print("\n".join(filenames))

# %%
# Just as easily, we can read all IDFs back into a single DataArray.
# We can do so by using a wildcard. These wildcards function according to
# the rules of `Glob`_ via the `python glob module`_.
#
# Note that every IDF has to have identical x-y coordinates: files with
# different cell sizes or extents will not be combined automatically.

back = imod.idf.open(tempdir / "*.idf")
back

# %%
# These glob patterns are quite versatile, and may be used to filter as well.

selection = imod.idf.open(tempdir / "transmissivity_l[1-5].idf")
selection

# %%
# Rather commonly, the paths of the IDFs are not named according to consistent
# rules. In such cases, we can manually specify how the name should be
# interpreted via the ``pattern`` argument.

back = imod.idf.open(tempdir / "*.idf", pattern="{name}_l{layer}")
back

# %%
# See the documenation of :py:func:`imod.idf.open` for more details.
#
# Other raster formats
# --------------------
#
# IDF is one raster format, but there are many more.
# :py:func:`imod.rasterio.open` wraps the `rasterio`_ Python package (which in
# turn wraps `GDAL`_) to provide access to many GIS raster formats.
# :py:func:`imod.rasterio.open` and :py:func:`imod.rasterio.save` work exactly
# the same as the respective IDF functions, except they write to a different
# format.
#
# For example, to write the transsmisivity to GeoTIFF:

imod.rasterio.save(tempdir / "transmissivity.tif", transmissivity)
filenames = [path.name for path in tempdir.iterdir()]
print("\n".join(filenames))

# %%
# Note :py:func:`imod.rasterio.save` will split the extension off the path,
# infer the `GDAL driver`_, attach the additional coordinates to the file name,
# and re-attach the extension.
#
# netCDF
# ------
#
# The final format to discuss here is `netCDF`_. Two dimensional raster files
# are convenient for viewing, as every file corresponds with a single "map
# view" in a GIS viewer. However, they are not convenient for storing many
# timesteps or many layers: especially long running simulations will generate
# hundreds, thousands, or even millions of files.
#
# netCDF is a file format specifically designed for multi-dimensional data, and
# allows us to conveniently bundle all data in a single file. Xarray objects
# can directly be written to netCDF, as the data model of xarray itself is
# based on the netCDF data model.
#
# With netCDF, there is no need to encode the different dimension labels in the
# the name: they are stored directly in the file instead.

layermodel.to_netcdf(tempdir / "layermodel.nc")
back = xr.open_dataset(tempdir / "layermodel.nc")
back

# %%
# Coordinate reference systems (CRS)
# ----------------------------------
#
# Reprojection from one CRS to another is a common frustration. Since the data
# in an xarray DataArray is always accompanied by its x and y coordinates, we
# can easily reproject the data. See the :doc:`../examples/prepare/reproject`.
#
# MODFLOW 6
# ---------
#
# iMOD Python's MODFLOW 6 module supports raster data in the form of xarray
# DataArrays. It will interpret data with an ``"x"`` and ``"y"`` coordinate
# automatically as data on structured grid. Let's create a structured
# discretization package (DIS) first. Note that MODFLOW 6 requires ``top`` to
# have only one layer, so we select the first layer of the layer model.
# Furthermore, the idomain is required to be an integer array, so we convert it
# to an integer type.

import imod

top = layermodel["top"].sel(layer=1)
idomain = layermodel["idomain"].astype(int)

dis = imod.mf6.StructuredDiscretization(
    top=top, bottom=layermodel["bottom"], idomain=idomain
)
dis

# %%
#
# Great! We can now use this discretization in a MODFLOW 6 model. Say we want to
# create a drainage package for overland flow. We can use the top array as drain
# elevation, but we only want drain cells in the first layer, where ``idomain ==
# 1``.

layer = layermodel.coords["layer"]
is_top_layer_and_active = (layer == 1) & (idomain == 1)
drain_elevation = layermodel["top"].where(is_top_layer_and_active)

# %%
#
# Next, we need to create a conductance array. The conductance is a measure of
# how much water can flow through a cell. We can use the areas of the cells to
# compute a conductance array.

area = layermodel["dx"] * layermodel["dy"] * -1
resistance = 1  # Example resistance value in days
conductance_value = area / resistance
conductance = conductance_value.where(is_top_layer_and_active)

# %%
#
# We can now create a drainage package object:

drn = imod.mf6.Drainage(
    elevation=drain_elevation,
    conductance=conductance,
)
drn
