Work with `iMOD <http://oss.deltares.nl/web/imod>`__ MODFLOW models in
Python.

Documentation: https://deltares.gitlab.io/imod-python/

Source code: https://gitlab.com/deltares/imod-python

Getting started
===============

In absence of actual documentation, here are some of the functions:

.. code:: python

    import imod

    df = imod.ipf.load('wells.ipf')
    imod.ipf.save('wells-out.ipf', df)

    # get all calculated heads in a xarray DataArray
    # with dimensions time, layer, y, x
    da = imod.idf.load('path/to/results/head_*.idf')

Notes
=====

-  The iMOD 4.1 release will crash on loading NaN nodata values. In
   earlier and later releases this is not an issue.

Implementation of ``imod.idf.load``
===================================

1. Do a ``glob`` search on all files matching the input path, e.g.
   ``head_*.idf``
2. For each IDF:
3. Gather all metadata from filename and IDF header
4. Load IDF array with ``np.memmap`` in ``r+`` mode.
5. Set nodata to ``np.nan`` (changes input file, done to be compatible
   with xarray)
6. Load ``np.memmap`` into a ``dask.array``
7. Combine metadata and ``dask.array`` into an ``xarray.DataArray``
8. Combine the indivual ``DataArray``\ s into one, adding ``time`` and
   ``layer`` dimensions as necessary.

With the current design, I'm not sure what the added benefit of using
dask arrays is, and whether it should be removed. One possible benefit
is that it is only possible to write to the ``DataArray`` after calling
``.load()`` on it first, which in this case still doesn't load it into
memory.

We can also still explore using the ``c`` *copy on write* mode of
``numpy.memmap``.

Comment by xarray author Stephan Hoyer about using ``np.memmap`` on
`GitHub <https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/1562#issuecomment-248681863>`__:

    If it's already on disk in a memory-mappable format, it's very hard
    to imagine beating np.memmap.
